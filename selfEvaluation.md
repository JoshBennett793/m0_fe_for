# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

	I'm fairly confident in my understanding and fluency with the `for` statement but there is more that I could learn and practice on in order to increase that confidence.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

	I feel good going outside of the curriculum and referring to documentation to remind myself of syntax or various methods that are available to me. I productively struggled by reading the prompt too quickly and misunderstanding what was expected of me. That led me to spending a few minutes on writing a piece of code that did not fulfill the expectations set by the prompt. I feel that I didn't unproductively struggle on this assignment. I reduced distractions and even multi-tasked completing this assignment while waiting for my pairing partner to join the zoom breakout room.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

	I need to be sure I'm thoroughly reading the prompt to ensure I'm not spending unnecessary time doing something that won't fulfill the expectations. I want to practice different kinds of loops like the `while` and `for... of` loops. I plan to do a bit of practice by practicing some coding challenges on sites like LeetCode when Mod 0 is finished. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

	I don't have any questions at this time but if I do I will be sure to utilize the appropriate Slack channel in an effort to find an answer.
